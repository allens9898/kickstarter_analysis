Welcome to the first weekly challenge in this course. Your weekly challenges provide an opportunity for you to demonstrate the skills you have learned in the module. These challenges are required and will be graded.

In this challenge, you will continue to exercise your Excel prowess! This time, you will create two new analyses: outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.

Background
Louise’s play Fever came close came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. How many other Kickstarter campaigns were able to do this as well? In this challenge, you’ll conduct a data analysis to answer this question and determine whether the length of a campaign contributes to its ultimate success or failure.

Objectives
The goals of this challenge are for you to:

Use filters and Excel formula to create new datasets
Create visualizations using Excel charts and pivot tables
Interpret the summary data provided from the visualizations
Instructions
Open Excel and create two sheets. Name them "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" and "Outcomes Based on Goals."

In the "Outcomes Based on Goals" sheet, do the following: 
1. Create 8 new columns with the following headings:

Goal
Number Successful
Number Failed
Number Canceled
Total Projects
Percentage Successful
Percentage Failed
Percentage Canceled
2. In the Goal column, create 12 new rows to sort each project. This will hold each goal range we're charting: 

Goal column with twelve rows of ranges

3. Use COUNTIFS()to count the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects within the newly defined ranges. (Filter the Kickstarter sheet to show only the Plays subcategory, otherwise, our scope includes all campaigns instead of the ones we are interested in.) Populate the appropriate columns.

4. Add each of the values in the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns to populate the Total Projects column.

5. Use division to find the percentage of projects that fall into each category (percentage successful, percentage failed, and percentage canceled).

6. Create a line chart to visualize the relationship between the goal amount and the campaign’s chances of success, failure, or cancellation.

7. Save the line chart as a .png image, like the one below.

In the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" sheet, do the following:
1. Create a pivot table that charts the outcome of each Kickstarter project based on the launch date.

2. Set the “Parent Category” filter to “theater” and save the chart as a .png image, like the one below.

Submission
Once your final analysis is complete, make sure the two new analyses are in the Outcomes Based on Goals and Outcomes Based on Launch Date sheets as described above. Save your worksheet and reupload it to your GitHub repository.

Next, update your README.md file as follows:

At the bottom of your sheet, add a third-level header for the challenge, i.e., ### Challenge
Under this section, add a short description of the new analysis and each .png file you saved earlier. 
Save your README file. Make sure the most recent copy is in your GitHub repository. 

Your homework will be submitted by providing a link to your new repository. To get this link, follow these steps. 

Navigate to www.github.com (Links to an external site.) in your browser and log in if you need to.
From the homepage, select your repository from the list on the left. Click the link to go to the homepage for that repository.
Select your repository from the list on the left.

Select the address in your search bar and copy it by highlighting the entire address and then right-clicking to select Copy. You can also copy by using the keyboard shortcut. This link can be shared with others so they can view the files in your repository or clone the repo if necessary. 
Select the address in your search bar.
Submit the link to your repository through Canvas.
Note: You are allowed to miss up to two Challenge assignments and still earn your certificate. If you complete all Challenge assignments, your lowest two grades will be dropped. If you wish to skip this assignment, click Submit and then type “I choose to skip this assignment” in the text box.
